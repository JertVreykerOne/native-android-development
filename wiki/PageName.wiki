= Introduction =

The relative lack of development tools currently on Android makes it somewhat difficult to develop natively on the platform.  On the other
hand, Ubuntu provides a very rich development environment.  Luckily Ubuntu can be configured to run quite well in tandem with Android, and (I believe) can be very useful in bootstrapping a native development environment for Android.
